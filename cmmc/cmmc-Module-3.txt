All right. Welcome back to the registered Practitioner Foundation's, RPF Module three, the CMMC accreditation Body, and the CMMC ecosystem.# Again, the information contained within the registered practitioner Foundation's RPF course is for the exclusive use of the C-M-M-C-A-B ecosystem members.# This information shall be considered C-M-M-C-A-B proprietary and shall not be disseminated, disclosed, or discussed outside the CMMC assessment consulting community.# That includes registered practitioners and RPO staff without the express written consent of the C-M-M-C-A-B. Remember that CMMC was created
and revised by Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, and the John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab with direction from the office of the Undersecretary# of Defense for acquisition and sustainment, which is O-U-S-D-A-N-S-C-M-M-C. Information is available at the link provided there, which of course we all know is, uh,# www dot acq. DO OSD dot mill slash cmmc. Remember, the views, opinions, and or findings contained within this material are those# of the author or authors, and should not be construed as official government position, policy, or decision unless designated by the the documents.# And we're gonna talk about those as we go throughout the content. Our agenda for module three, we're gonna go over the CMMC accreditation body.# Uh, our topic two is going to be the CMMC ecosystem, and then topic three is going to be the ecosystem stakeholders,
and it was run by independent board of directors. We currently have, uh, eight board of directors. We started with 15, we're down to about eight.# And then of course, we have an executive staff that kind of filled in some of those gaps, especially with the academic side of the house.# We have continued feedback from industry working groups, uh, and there's different working groups from time to time. And then of course, we have different industry advisory# councils, and we slowly stand up more and more of our advisory councils as the ecosystem evolves a little bit of history and independence.# Uh, how, how did this all begin? Uh, we began in, uh, with A-D-O-D-R-F-I, and that began in October 3rd of, uh, 2019.
but it's a formal, uh, recognition as a nonprofit entity with the US Internal Revenue Service. And it was pending for the longest time.# Uh, and then right at the end of last year, we did receive our nonprofit status. Uh, the CMMC operates just like any other private# nonprofit organization. Uh, independence does not mean, uh, information is siloed. Uh, the one of the neat things over last year# and even into the beginning of this year is that we do have a very good, strong working relationship with, uh, O-U-S-D-A-N-S, uh,# with the undersecretary of Department of Defense. And that allows us to share information back and forth to help mature the, the CMMC model, uh,
and that's how things get implemented. So it, it is definitely neat to see how everything was formed, but this was the beginning foundational steps of how,# how everything formed in the CMMC ab. Granted, there's a lot more to it than that, but that's just a overview.# The CMMC AB Board of Directors. So in the beginning, and still to this day, uh, it's an all volunteer board# of directors that still hasn't changed. Uh, the neat part about this is we have a very diverse, uh, set of people with, uh, I mean, their backgrounds,# anything from cybersecurity expert. Um, technology is definitely the, the, the backbone of all of our board of directors. Uh, but then the, the neat part is# that we have risk management expert. Uh, we have lead appraisers, uh, lawyers, uh, academics, and then even educators. Uh, some of our, our board members, uh, do, you know,
to generate its own revenue. Uh, that's through dues and fees, our relationships with other partnerships, uh, conferences, which will come later on.# You know, as we get the ecosystem up and running, you know, in full force. And then other sources as we, we generate revenue, you know,# down, down the road, things will come up and our partners will come up with other ideas. Uh, it's kind of one of the neat,# definite neat things about the way CMMC is built, is that, uh, a lot of people pride didn't see it in the beginning,# but our partners definitely come up with ideas every day. Uh, and then those get, um, kind of funneled to the DOD.# We make suggestions and recommendations to the DOD if they think is a good solution, that proposal that will go back to the partners,
cybersecurity aspects, uh, and that those will be coming over the next year or two, uh, as we work with, uh, academic environments# and trying to get, uh, the, the big strategy, right, A lot of people don't see this in the longer term,# but that the idea is to build a new assessor, uh, pool. We have a lot of experienced assessors, but we, uh, with the old frameworks,# we weren't pulling in a lot of the younger, uh, generation to get new experience. So from academics of universities# and colleges, uh, getting crossover from either other frameworks or people that were just IT professionals to help desk, or something else that just wanted to# transition from doing something very simple. Now, they could go to a college program that had CMMC inside of it, uh, or to a tech trade
the, our, our NIST 801 71, uh, assessments that the DC made DIB CAC was doing. So that's things that were added to, to ensure# that cybersecurity com, uh, compliance requirements were being met. And then requirements of implementation, uh, of CMMC by contractors through DAR.# So we're gonna see contractor requirements as they go through rule making here, uh, throughout this year and into early next year as they build, uh, the dfars,# uh, 2 52 0.204 dash 72 1 for CMMC. We'll, we'll get to see some of the requirements that come out of that.# We obviously know they're changing. Now with the, the CMMC version 2.0. AV manages the ecosystem. Uh, and a lot of people get this, uh, kind of construed,
that feedback seriously and take it to the DOD so that any kind of issues or recommendations can actually be thought about# and implemented if it, if the DOD thinks that it's necessary. We also issue additional guidance, uh, and other documentation.# The cap, uh, is, uh, the CMMC assessment process is one of those, uh, additional documentations. Now, granted, uh, the cap has taken a long time, uh,# to put together because it fundamentally, uh, bridges the gap between a lot of different aspects of the, the assessment process.# Uh, and with that, uh, the, the idea is that the assessment guides give us that foundational, uh, what we're supposed to do.
that change throughout the, the version two changes as we get onto assessments and, uh, prep work starts. Uh, I know it's happening already,# but as we get more involved in the, the level two prep work on CMMC version two, and, and we talked to people doing level one,# I know it's only 17 practices, but there's definitely going to be some strategic, um, talks about what we can and can, what we can# and, uh, should be doing to, to help those Level one organizations design for scalability. I think, as most people have already figured out, uh,# it is definitely scalable because we've been changing this thing since day one. Uh, it hasn't failed. Uh, I know a lot of people get skeptical
So there's definitely a lot coming out in the, the months, uh, following rule making. But in the interim, uh, with CMC 2.0, there's definitely# that, that big change of, uh, allowing incentives, uh, to begin the assessments. The ecosystem, for those of you who've seen the,# the original, uh, version of the, the ecosystem, it, it's still that big. Uh, but this is, uh, shrinking it down# to make it a little bit easier to understand. Uh, we start with the, the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, O-U-S-D-A-N-S, the acquisitions# and sustainment, uh, for, uh, and we all know they, they've moved up to the CIO's office, um, but they are still flagging underneath a NS, uh,
what the, the C-M-M-C-A-B was going to do. The CACO will then will be on the training side of the house.# Of course, when we, the, when we do this split of, of the two entities, uh, this will allow us# to focus more on the different members. Uh, we're kind of already doing it, uh, but, uh, it'll allow us to build different staffs, uh,# on each side of the, the C-M-M-C-A-B, uh, that are more focused on individual and organizational level members. Uh, where right now it's, uh, you know, seven of us,# and we're kind of focused on everybody. Uh, and we're slowly doing the break. Uh, but it will, it will, I tell you from my point of view,
are definitely endless. Uh, the, the more involved they are, the more resources they would be able to get. They would have definite instant, um,# interaction with registered practitioners, assessors information at their hands. And I think we can all understand that the, the ecosystem members, I mean,# the information we all have is thinly remarkable. The amount of people that, uh, are ready in the ecosystem ready to go.# So this is definitely one, one benefit of adding the OSCs into the marketplace and getting them involved in the ecosystem.# Uh, CMSC, third party Assessor Organization, C3 pos. Uh, of course, we have two different versions of, um, C3 POS in the marketplace.# Currently. We have accredited and then candidate pending L two assessment with the DCMA DIB cac. Uh, this is no real big change.
to have one rp, uh, and you had like, the 30 day grace period to get one. Uh, but now, just so everybody understood that, uh,# RPS fundamentally fit underneath an RPO, uh, granted, uh, it's the, the, uh, an implementer can kind of be anywhere.# But, uh, it was just a, so that people understood, you know, fundamentally where people belong. Um, if you're gonna do implementations# and you're a registered practitioner, you're gonna be underneath a registered provider. So the, the, the DOD just wanted to emphasize that.# Again, the links provided right here, if you wanna check it out. And like I said, over the next couple months,# there's gonna be a big initiative, uh, to updating the pages, providing more resources. Uh, this is a big campaign for the, the AB as well
were concerned because they had no, um, no organization to watch over them. Um, some people do it individually, and they're just used to it.# And then, um, for the, the large portion, they wanted that, that oversight. You're working for a contractor, uh, you know,# who's, who's in charge of it? Are there gonna be multiple rps working underneath an RPO? So that, that was one of the biggest things.# They wanted to know who they fell under. Do you, do you work for a C3 PO? Do you work for an RPO?# Who do you work for? So we, we, we drew this out and actually showed everybody who they work for# and what, what the original idea was. So RPOs and RPS work together, C3 pos and, uh, assessors work together.
I mean, there's a lot of requirements that come with it. They are an assessment team member. Uh, they're allowed to, to view, to view# that 15% of the assessment. Of course, it's only level one, the same thing you'd be able to do on a level one assessment.# Uh, so it's very, very restrictive, uh, but it allows to the reduction of 15% of the assessment team workload, uh,# in this first couple years, uh, hopefully only first year until we can, uh, boost the assessor pool. Um, so this is one of the big changes in version 2.0# is allowing the CCPs to sit on a level two assessment. Ideally, that would've been a level three, uh, on version one.# But, uh, this is definitely a, a key change. Our certified CMMC assessors, uh, granted, uh, for this first, uh, year, as we go through,
Uh, this is currently in development. The DODs working with us on this. Uh, you must be a current CCA, uh, to hold the designation.# And then all assessment teams must have a lead assessor. This is a no if and or, but, uh, this was a, a big change, uh, going into 2.0.# Uh, and then, of course, the, the lead assessor course and designation requirements are still being developed by the DOD, the CMMC ecosystem stakeholders.# Uh, we have four reliant organizations, organizations seeking certification, our OSCs individuals performing services, uh, our IPS, and then our service provider organizations.# So, reliant organizations. They rely on, obviously, our CMMC certifications to make decisions about the members of their supply chain.
and OSC is just fundamentally, uh, a plus here. Uh, not only that, this is one of those things that I don't think a lot of people understand.# Uh, having a C3 PO or an RPO in the middle of stuff helps those teams of implementers or assessors, uh,# get stuff done a little bit more smoothly, number one, and then finalize stuff a little bit faster, as long# as they're trained properly, uh, anywhere from scoping, uh, to helping them get their contract stuff through quicker. Because a trained representative at a C3 PO# can allow them to scope things properly. And then the assessment team comes in and everything's done properly, where if they were trying
Uh, a lot of filtering and different stuff that you can do inside there with your, uh, members underneath your organization.# Service provider organization designation. So we have RPOs and C3 pos, which you heard me talking about. Um, our RPOs over here on the left hand side, um, are,# we have requirements to find on the website. Uh, so if you, if you go out there and you look at it, uh, the,# they're always subject to change. We haven't really changed 'em too much. Uh, basic business background check. Uh, there's an annual fee, uh,# provide consulting services to OSCs. Uh, the biggest thing is that they help create cybersecurity programs that will either meet or exceed CMMC requirements.
Um, I mean, I've, I've been there on that side of the house, and this can get very involved. Uh, but that's ideally up to, um, your rps.# Uh, they consult with OICs on assessment preparation, anything from scoping to objective evidence and collection and storage. Uh, they are not authorized# to participate on formal assessment teams. And I just said that in the last slide, ideally, uh, uh, rp. And so I'm, I'm gonna try to stay this# and not confuse anybody. An RP can be on the assessment. So if an os, so if you prepped, um, an assessment# that OSC could invite you back to be there during the assessment, you just wouldn't be part of the assessment team.
or RPO staff that hey, we got, you know, uh, this C3 PO that, you know, normally is really great at# assessments, however it works. Or they might already know somebody. So they got a C3 po and now we have an assessment team.# Uh, that assessment team could be comprised of CCPs and CCAs and of course, the lead assessor. So the assessments begins.# Once the assessment is over, the results will go into, uh, CMMC eMASS if everything is good. Uh, granted, we're still waiting on a OAM policy, uh,# but even with the poem policy, as long as they meet the requirements of the, the POM policy from the DOD, they would get.# So say they do have a couple POM items, as long as they meet the requirements of the DOD, they would get an interim certification.
our C3 pos and our RPOs, and then we have individuals performing services, uh, our rps, our CCPs, and our CCAs.# And then just remember, we don't wanna have any conflicts of interest. So if you prep an assessment prep for an assessment# as an RPO or CCP or CCA, you don't want to go back to that same, uh, organization seeking certification as an assessor.# I thank you for following me through this module, and I will see you in module four.
