We thank you for taking the time to go through the registered practitioner foundations RPF course, we also thank you for your patience throughout the last year and a half. Throughout the changes and especially with the changes to cmmc version 2.0. There's more to come in this year and remember that we're here for you. Keep Fielding your questions. Start using the RP forums most of all. Keep doing those implementations and talking to the osc's and being that Forefront for the cmmc ecosystem. We look forward to seeing you in the level two RP course.
