should not be construed as an official government position policy or decision unless designated. by other documentation, this module consists of three topics. Topic one. We will go over protecting. information and topic 2 will go over the legal obligations and a, topic 3 will go over Federal contract information FCI. topiccoin protecting information our nation's adversaries are always on the hunt for, information even information that may seem irrelevant. at first glance take for example an order for 200 boxes of contact, chip PVC smart cards. These are a CAC cards for those of you who are used to DOD or you use them at your, workplace. For some of us we're used to using cards. RF cards or stuff to scan into buildings, but for the dod it's a common common, access card to use to get into the facility number one to get actually into the gate and then to log into computers., and in here we're going to kind of use this scenario as throughout we're going to talk about our DOD supply company
contractors to understand that it is. Cmmc level one certification that aligns with existing requirements under the federal acquisition regulations. These requirements are included, in most government contracts. This means that the current US government contractors are already asserting that they meet these basic requirements, and just We're all kind of used to this. If you've been dealing with defense contractors with respect to this module's topic. You're probably also saying, okay,, so, how can my client tell whether something is FCI or not this kind of question. We get a lot here at the CMC AV in the, next few topics. We've designed this these this particular module to kind of help you understand and make these distinctions., Topic 2 is legal obligations. As you can see from our discussions so far regardless of where your clients organization is in defense, boats supply chain. It is important that they properly Safeguard the government sensitive information. As we will discuss in Greater detail in the later modules. It, is responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the contract clause are clauses that impose safeguarding requirements. for sensitive information flow down
Within the executive branch, each agency has a lot of latitude to Define how it operates for many years. This included the ability, to determine what goods and services it needed to purchase and how those should be purchased. This led to inconsistent and occasionally conflicting, requirements from different agencies. And then in turn meant that suppliers had to create different versions of goods or services for different, agencies. This increased the cost to the government. In the 1980s to increase efficiency and reduce costs the government instituted the federal Acquisitions, regulation or the far. The far is the primary regulation for use by all executive agencies in their acquisition of supply and services with, appropriate funds the far is used for most contracts within the executive branch with certain exceptions that are outside the scope of this course., The far defines a common set of acquisition related requirements and corresponding contract language that can be incorporated into contracts, by Contracting officers within the agency. information safeguarding obligations And of course for this course, we're looking at everything underneath far
a contract are simply just aren't there. Sometimes those Clauses are critical to the mute the procurement. In 1963 the US court, of federal claims decided that case called GL Christian and Associates versus the United States in that case the government left out key far Clauses, from the a government contract and the Court held that the government contractors are presumed to be for familiar with the far and that, mandatory Clauses that Express a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy will be read into government contract, by operation of law. This is true, even if the parties intentionally omitted that clause That is a significant departure from traditional, contract law and catches some contractors by surprise the concept that a contract clause can be incorporated into a contract, with the US federal government. Even when the parties have expressively agreed otherwise is referred to as a Christian doctrine., Contractors have been either explicitly self-certifying compliance under far 52.204-21 for years. This creates potential issues under the false claims
inside the cmmc community and for the cyber security in general cross the defense industrial base. Topic 3 is federal contract information FCI., Let's start by looking at the definition of federal contract information. FCI if you are familiar with the executive branch contracts, it, is important to understand that many of the contracts are based around the federal acquisition regulation or far the far defines the legal., And other requirements needed to do business with Executive Branch. The far is broken down into a series of parts with each part given a, reference number when you're looking for help with understanding executive branch contracts. There are a number of great resources out there. However, when it comes to defining terms, it is best to look to the source in this case Federal and attract information is defined in Far 52.204-21 which, states that FCI is information. Not intended for public release provided by or generated for the government under a contract to develop or deliver a product or, service to the government. That was helpful, right? Let's break that down a little bit more. we know FCI is limited to
Force the contractor to handle that information. In certain ways but strictly speaking. The munition specifications are not FCI because they, were not created under a contract with government. pay close attention to what government regulations each type of information falls under, of course and not the course here. We're specifically looking at FCI Federal contract information, but there are other regulations out there with the, federal government. In this module, we have discussed protecting information from our nation's adversaries legal obligations that are tied to Government Contracting containing, FCI and defining and breaking down Federal contract information. Again, we thank you for your attention module 5 is next prime and subcontractor, information flow.
